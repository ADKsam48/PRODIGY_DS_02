Greetings Everyone,

I'm excited to announce the successful completion of Task-02 during my Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech!

Task Overview: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

I'm eager and ready to take more challenges in the dynamic field of Data Science!
